##The Rant
ScoreKeeper is a very simple score keeping "app" that allows players of any game that requires score keeping -like card games-
to save scores, it was created for mobile devices hence the makeshift keyboard it uses was to address the fact 
that i needed to add negative values and my android device back then didn't play really well with the HTML5 numbers field.

###THE Not FAQ, YOU

####Why release now? 
It was inside a Gdrive folder since March and i saw [a post on Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6725387) 
about a "spreadsheet in fewer than 30 lines of JavaScript" and i decided ohh i created something similar but of course with libraries
and not to prove any point rather than to solve the annoyance we had me and my friends while playing cards and having to keep
calculating the acculmating scores, plus it was fun to create, so yeah bottom line i thought someone might find it useful.

I also fealt jealous :(

####But ... BUT ... THIS IS NOT A Micro Ninja Parser Functional Currying framework
I know, it doesn't have to be.

####So why are you wasting our valuable times?
I think you are wasting your time, i am not, i am enjoying mine.

####Github is not a blog!
